# New York Times Search

## Purpose
As I continue my coding journey I am going back over each of my assignments from the bootcamp. The New York Times Search was an in class assignment that ended our chapter on using web based apis. The assignment was actually one of the lengthier of its kind during the course. The assignment calls for a groupd of four to be split into a "front-end" and "back-end" teams. We were given a pdf of what the end resutl would look like and given written instructions on how it was to work. I remember taking the front end responsibility the first time around. This time I did the project entirely on my own in about an hour and a half. 

## Process
I'm not even sure how close to done this assignment was when time was up. I spent most of the time styling the html. In hindsight I was disappointed in myslef for sticking to my comfort zone and not taking on the challenge of using the apis. I think doing it on my own has really helped me better understand api calls. Over all the project only took me about an hour and a half to complete. I just started with the basic layout in HTML and then called the api using ajax and rendered the information into elements dynamically.
